1. What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special method in Java that is used to initialize objects. It is called when an instance of a class is created. The name of the constructor must be the same as the class name, and it does not have a return type.

2. What is Constructor Chaining?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another within the same class or from a derived class using the `this` or `super` keyword. It allows better code reusability and minimizes redundancy.

3. Can we call a subclass constructor from a superclass constructor?
No, a superclass constructor cannot directly call a subclass constructor. However, a subclass constructor can call a superclass constructor using the `super` keyword.

4. What happens if you keep a return type for a constructor?
If a return type is specified for a constructor, it will be treated as a regular method and not as a constructor. This means the compiler will not recognize it as a constructor and will not invoke it automatically when an object is created.

5. What is a No-arg Constructor?
A no-argument constructor (no-arg constructor) is a constructor that does not take any parameters. It is commonly used to initialize objects with default values.

class Example {
    Example() {  // No-arg constructor
        System.out.println("No-arg constructor called");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
    }
}
```

6. How is a No-argument Constructor different from the Default Constructor?
A default constructor is a no-argument constructor automatically provided by the compiler if no constructor is explicitly defined in the class. However, if a constructor is manually defined in the class, the compiler does not generate a default constructor.

7. When do we need Constructor Overloading?
Constructor overloading is needed when we want to create multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists. It allows objects to be initialized in different ways depending on the input.
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    
    // No-arg constructor
    Person() {
        this.name = "Unknown";
        this.age = 0;
    }
    
    // Parameterized constructor
    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

8. What is a Default Constructor? Explain with an Example.
A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments and is automatically provided by the Java compiler if no other constructors are defined.
Example:

class Animal {
    Animal() { // Default constructor
        System.out.println("An animal is created");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Animal();
    }
}
```
In this example, the constructor `Animal()` is a default constructor, which gets called when an object of `Animal` is created.
